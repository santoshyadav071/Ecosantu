                    The difference between mid-top and high-top shoes is how high they
                    go on your ankle. Mid-top shoes generally reach to your ankle,
                    while high-top shoes cover the ankle entirely, which may give you
                    a marginal amount of added stability and general coolness.

                    High tops are super comfy! Wearing high tops should be just as
                    comfortable as wearing other sneakers, with a bit more coverage
                    around the ankle. If you&apos;re wearing our Wool Runner-up Mizzles,
                    the ZQ Merino wool upper is like a bonus boost of coziness for
                    your ankles.

                    The break-in period for shoes can vary depending on the material
                    of the shoes, their design, and what you do in them. If your
                    Wool-based Allbirds are a bit snug to start, you can expect them
                    to stretch about a quarter of an inch after a few weeks of wear.
                    (In contrast, your Tree-based shoes will likely retain their
                    original shape.) Either way, we recommend wearing them for 1-2
                    weeks to fully break in. Yes, this means your Allbirds shoes get
                    more comfy as you wear them.

                    Your slip-on shoes should give you a secure fit without feeling
                    overly constricting. They should feel comfortable and stable, with
                    minimal slippage as you walk. However, it&apos;s equally important that
                    they aren&apos;t so tight that they cause rubbing or pinchingâ€”no one
                    wants discomfort or blisters from tight shoes. In general, there
                    should be sufficient space in the front part of the shoe (the toe
                    box) for your toes to wiggle freely. Plus, a small gap (roughly
                    the width of your thumb) should exist between your longest toe and
                    the tip of the shoe.
