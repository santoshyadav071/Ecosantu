            Every now and then, our shoes need a refresh. So they leave our
            closets, but then what? Unfortunately, most end up in a landfill,
            where they emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere while they
            decompose over the next, oh, thirty or forty years. It’s a far from
            perfect option, and we’ve been working on finding a better one. One
            solution? Extending the life of our shoes by finding them a new
            home.
