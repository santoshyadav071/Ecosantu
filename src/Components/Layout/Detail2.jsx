              The ECO PASSPORT-Certified (by OEKO-TEX®) water-repellent coating
              on the Allbirds Mizzles is pretty amazing—but its effectiveness
              can lessen over time depending on the conditions you wear them in
              and how well they are maintained. Heavy usage, particularly in wet
              conditions, can wear down the shoe’s water-resistant properties
              faster.

              Yes—but not every Allbirds style is made for rain, so choose
              carefully! If you’re looking for everyday water-resistant shoes,
              we suggest the Mizzles, which have a breathable, bio-based shield
              and wool upper treated with a water-repellent coating. The Men’s
              Trail Runners SWT, an off-road trail running shoe, also features a
              durable, water-resistant finish that keeps shoes from getting
              soggy from the occasional puddle. If you forgot your umbrella and
              your Allbirds shoes get fully soaked, we recommend letting them
              dry in the sun before wearing them again. (Learn more about caring
              for and washing Allbirds shoes.)

              While many water-resistant footwear is made from synthetic
              materials, Allbirds has found materials that are much kinder on
              the planet. Shoes like the Mizzles are made with a resilient
              merino wool upper and treated with a bio-based water-repellent
              coating, so they’re ideal for rainy weather and wet conditions.
              Or, try the Trail Runner SWTs, our signature hiking / trail
              running shoe that can handle wet conditions without skipping a
              beat. The materials in the SWT—or “Sugar, Wool, Tree”—are a triple
              threat of sustainable materials: SweetFoam® sugarcane midsole with
              a wool and eucalyptus tree fiber upper. If your Allbirds shoes end
              up completely soaked for whatever reason (it’s hard to resist
              stomping in a puddle from time to time), we recommend letting them
              dry in the sun before wearing them again. (Learn more about caring
              for and washing Allbirds shoes.)

              No, water-resistant doesn't mean waterproof. Water-resistant
              materials can endure light rain and occasional splashes without
              letting moisture seep into the shoe. They’re great for bashing
              around comfortably in all conditions. The Allbirds Mizzles are
              crafted with a wool upper that's been treated with a
              water-repellent coating. This helps to ward off water and rain in
              damp conditions, keeping your feet drier.

              Mist + Drizzle = Mizzle. Combining cozy ZQ Merino wool and a
              bio-based water-repellent shield, our rain-ready sneaker keeps
              your feet predictably dry in unpredictable weather. The absolute
              last thing you want during wet weather is wet, soggy feet. If the
              winter weather gets a little bit wet where you live, a little bit
              of extra protection can go a long way. Here’s a free tip: All of
              our Mizzles shoes are treated with water-repellent Puddle Guard®
              technology to help prevent moisture from getting inside and
              ruining your day. Perfect for winter, our high-top Wool Runner-Up
              Mizzles not only provide some added coverage around the ankles but
              also come with the aforementioned water-repellent treatment to
              keep your feet dry if you ever wander into a snowy puddle or find
              yourself out in the elements during some of that frosty winter
              weather. Not interested in a high-top style? Wool Runner Mizzles
              are for you.
