            There’s just something about the simplicity of sliding your feet
            into a great pair of slip-on shoes. You’re taking a shortcut of
            sorts, freeing you from the burdensome task of lacing up your shoes
            and getting things just right before you head out the door. But are
            slip-on shoes in style? They are when you wear a pair that boasts
            the sleek and understated look of our Wool Loungers—perfect for a
            business casual day when you want your feet to be comfortably
            cradled. Looking for something breezy enough to wear around the
            house or out running errands all day? Consider our Tree Loungers;
            the more airy and breathable cousin of their wool counterpart. And
            don’t worry, active folks—we designed a slip-on shoe for you as
            well. Our renowned Tree Dasher Relays offer the performance,
            stability, and support you need from a workout shoe but in a
            convenient and wildly comfortable slip-on form.
