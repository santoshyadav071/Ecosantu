              Allbirds fit true to size for most customers. If you have wide
              feet or are between sizes, we suggest you size up for all styles.
              Did you know that our shoes are actually unisex? You can easily
              cross over to find shoes in your size. Here’s how it works: If you
              wear a men’s size 7, try a women’s size 8 or 9. If you wear a
              women’s size 12, try a men’s size 10 or 11.

              1. Remove the laces and insoles. 2. Place shoes in a delicates bag
              (pro tip: a pillowcase works too). 3. Choose a gentle cycle with
              cold water & mild detergent. 4. Shake out any excess water & set
              aside to air dry. 5. Shoes will regain their original shape with
              one or two wears. Want the full refresh experience? Swap in some
              new laces and insoles.
