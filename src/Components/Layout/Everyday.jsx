                What in the world is an everyday shoe? Well, the answer is in the
                question, to an extent, but let's really break it down for a moment.
                An everyday shoe is one you're perfectly content wearing, well,
                every day. That can mean different things to some, but to us, there
                are a few things we're looking for in an everyday shoe.

                First, there's the comfortability. You want a shoe that feels good on your
                foot all day long, whether you're walking the dog, running a quick
                errand or two, or logging some hours at your desk during work hours.
                This makes breathability an essential factor in the everyday
                equation—you don't want your feet to spend hours in a stuffy, humid
                shoe.

                The second most vital aspect? Looks, of course. Everyday shoes
                should offer a stylish yet versatile look—something you can wear
                pretty much anywhere while still looking crisp and put together.
                This collection of Allbirds shoes checks off every box you can think
                of when it comes to a true comfortable everyday shoe for men, all
                while being crafted from sustainable materials.
