            Ever had cold feet? Sure, we all have—literally and figuratively.
            But what’s worse than literal cold feet? As in, the kind caused by
            wet shoes. When the weather is wet, be prepared for your environment
            with proper water-repellent shoes. Allbirds Mizzles are your answer.
            With an ECO PASSPORT Certified (by OEKO-TEX®) fluorine-free water
            repellent coating, each shoe in the Mizzles collection offers an
            effective barrier between normal precipitation and the occasional
            splash from a puddle. That means you can make the brave trek from
            the parking lot to the store in the rain without getting soggy feet.
            Or the subway to the office. Or out to walk the dog. You get it. And
            with options like our high top, throwback style Runner-Ups, you can
            even add some additional ankle coverage to the water-resistant shoes
            mix.
