                What's the difference between the Tree Runner and Wool Runner?
              </span>
            </summary>
            <p>
              The main difference is in the material and feel. Tree Runners are made with eucalyptus fiber, making them light, breathable and ideal for warm weather. Wool Runners use merino wool which provides natural temperature regulation and moisture-wicking properties, making them cozy and versatile year-round.

              All our shoes are machine washable! Remove the insoles and laces, place them in a delicates bag, and wash in cold water on a gentle cycle. Air dry away from direct heat or sunlight. For spot cleaning, you can use a gentle brush with mild soap and water.

              While our Tree Runners and Wool Runners are great for everyday activities and light exercise, we recommend our Tree Dashers or Wool Dashers for dedicated running shoes. These models are specifically engineered with additional support and cushioning for running activities.

              We use natural, renewable materials like merino wool and eucalyptus fiber, recycled plastic bottles for our laces, and sugarcane-based SweetFoamâ„¢ for our soles. We're also carbon neutral through reduction initiatives and offsets, and all our packaging is made from 90% recycled cardboard.
